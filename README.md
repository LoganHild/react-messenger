  ## Description
  A barebones react messenging app using Socket.io.

  ## Installation
  N/A

  ## Usage
  Upon entering the application, the user will be asked to either login or create a new account. If the user creates a new account, a unique id will be generated for them using uuid. Once the id has been generated the user can see their id in the lower left hand side of the screen. This is the id they will use almost like their email on the app. They can click the contact section to add new contacts to their list. The user will be asked for a unique id as well as the name they would like associated with that id. Once the new contact is added the user can click the conversations tab and create a new conversation with that person. When creating a new converation the user will be shown a checkbox of their contacts to select who will be a part of the conversation. After creating the conversation simply click the listed conversation in the tab and start typing the message in the textarea shown on the right side of the screen.
